**Check Your Understanding** 
1.  Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline? Select one of the following and explain why.

            won't be added to main in push/pull requests are being used. The Github actions are also useful in identifying which 
            tests the code pushed failed, so a developer can identify problems more efficiently without messing up the main branch.
2.   Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output? (yes/no) 
     1.   I would **not**.
